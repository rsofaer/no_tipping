A solver for the no tipping game, for Dennis Shasha's Heuristics class of Fall 2011
Compile with "cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:string=Release ./"
             "javac *.java"
run with "java Contestant <port_number>"
The java app expects the c++ "no_tipping_game executable to be in the working directory.

Thanks!
